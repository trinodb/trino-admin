==================
Configuring Presto
==================

Presto configuration parameters can be modified to
tweak performance or add/remove features. While Presto is designed to work
well out-of-the-box, you still may need to make some changes.


Memory configuration
--------------------

It is often necessary to change the default memory configuration based on your
cluster's capacity. The default max memory for each Presto server is 16 GB, but
if you have a lot of memory (say, 120GB/node), you may want to allocate more
memory to Presto for better performance.

In order to update the max memory value to 60 GB per node:

1. Change the line in ``~/.prestoadmin/coordinator/jvm.config`` and
   ``~/.prestoadmin/workers/jvm.config`` that says ``-Xmx16G`` to ``-Xmx60G``.

2. Change the following lines in ``~/.prestoadmin/coordinator/config.properties``
   and ``~/.prestoadmin/workers/config.properties``:

.. code-block:: none

        query.max-memory-per-node=8GB
        query.max-memory=50GB

to:

.. code-block:: none

        query.max-memory-per-node=30GB
        query.max-memory=<30GB * number of nodes>

We recommend setting ``query.max-memory-per-node`` to half of the JVM config
max memory, though if your workload is highly concurrent, you may want
to use a lower value for ``query.max-memory-per-node``. If you have large
data skew, ``query.max-memory-per-node`` should.
By default in Presto 148t and higher, ``query.max-memory-per-node`` is 10%
of the ``Xmx`` value specified in ``jvm.config``.

3. Run the following command to deploy the configuration change to the cluster:

.. code-block:: none

     ./presto-admin configuration deploy

4. Restart the Presto servers so that the changes get picked up:

.. code-block:: none

     ./presto-admin server restart

If you are running Presto in a test environment that has less than 16 GB of
memory available, you will need to follow similar procedures to set the
memory configurations lower.

Log file location configurations
--------------------------------

For most production environments, it will be necessary to change the log
locations. In order to update these:

1. Stop the Presto server.

.. code-block:: none

    ./presto-admin server stop

2. Presto stores logs and other data in ``node.data-dir``,
   ``node.launcher-log-file``, and ``node.server-log-file``. It is very
   important that these locations have enough space for the logs on the
   filesystem on each node where Presto is running. The default location
   for ``node.data-dir`` is ``/var/lib/presto/data``, the default location
   for ``node.launcher-log-file`` is ``/var/log/presto/launcher.log``, and
   the default location for ``node.server-log-file`` is
   ``/var/log/presto/server.log``. Assuming the chosen locations are
   ``/data1/presto`` and ``/data2/presto`` for the data directory
   and server logs respectively, the properties in
   ``~/.prestoadmin/coordinator/node.properties`` and
   ``~/.prestoadmin/workers/node.properties`` will be as follows::

    node.data-dir=/data1/presto/data
    node.launcher-log-file=/data2/presto/launcher.log
    node.server-log-file=/data2/presto/server.log

3. The log directories (in the above example, ``/data1/presto`` and
   ``/data2/presto``; the ``data`` directory for ``node.data-dir`` is
   created by Presto) need to exist on all nodes and be owned by the
   ``presto`` user. The command ``presto-admin run_script`` can be used
   to perform these actions on all of the nodes. First, create a script in
   the same directory as ``presto-admin``, called ``script.sh``::

    #!/bin/bash
    mkdir -p /data1/presto
    mkdir -p /data2/presto
    chown presto:presto /data1/presto
    chown presto:presto /data2/presto

Then, run the following command:

.. code-block:: none

    ./presto-admin run_script script.sh

4. Run the following command to deploy the log configuration change to the
   cluster:

.. code-block:: none

    ./presto-admin configuration deploy

5. Restart the Presto servers so that the changes get picked up:

.. code-block:: none

    ./presto-admin server restart
